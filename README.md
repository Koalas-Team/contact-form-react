test for ddcif.com contact form

As requested i used an alternative way to get the mail contact form
its called nodemailer
using smtp from the ddcif.com host created a user and tested
i coudn't merge build this repo from my machine it keeps giving me errors not sure why
i installed but still not working
anyways i worked the form in separate repo
merge this https://github.com/maqalaqil/contact-form-react.git
merge this repo to this one
/server has all files to launch node mailer
the rest is just a contact form in react
I think nothing hard to copy and paste
enjoy :)

works only in the host. (for ddcif.com)
to test you can use this
https://ethereal.email/create
and copy the mail that was created and paste it in server/mailer/index.js
so you can test that everything is working locally
